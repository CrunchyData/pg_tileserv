# pg_tileserv

`pg_tileserv` is a [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/)-only tile server in [Go](https://golang.org/). Strip away all the other requirements, it just has to take in HTTP tile requests and form and execute SQL.  In a sincere act of flattery, the API and design look a lot like that of the [Martin](https://github.com/urbica/martin) tile server.

This guide will walk you through how to install and use `pg_tileserv` for your spatial applications. The [Usage](./usage) section goes in-depth on how the service works. We also include some [basic examples](./examples) of web maps that render tiles from `pg_tileserv`.
